# Measuring atoll island land area change in Google Earth Engine

The scripts in this repo show how I used Google Earth Engine to measure atoll island land area change at a global scale.

The rationale behind this research was very simple.

- Due to effects of climate change (sea level rise, increase in storminess etc.) there is global concern surrounding the future persistence of atoll islands, which represent the only habitable land for nations such as Tokelau, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands.

- Despite this concern, there have been relatively few studies which have quantitatively assessed atoll island change to date, resulting in limited and fragmentary monitoring of island land area.

- To date, research has occurred at the scale of individual atolls or small numbers of proximate islands while generally utilizing only two or three observations. This limited scale is the result of the availability and cost of high resolution satellite and historic aerial imagery.

- The number of islands that may reasonably be covered is also limited by the time-consuming nature of the existing approach: the shoreline or accepted shoreline proxy of the island(s) in question is digitized from the high resolution imagery by hand using ArcMap, a tricky process that requires careful attention.
