## Introduction

The rationale behind this research was very simple.

- Due to effects of climate change (sea level rise, increase in storminess etc.) there is global concern surrounding the future persistence of atoll islands, which represent the only habitable land for nations such as Tokelau, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands.

- Despite this concern, there have been relatively few studies which have quantitatively assessed atoll island change to date, resulting in limited and fragmentary monitoring of island land area.

- To date, research has occurred at the scale of individual atolls or small numbers of proximate islands while generally utilizing only two or three observations. This limited scale is the result of the availability and cost of high resolution satellite and historic aerial imagery.

- The number of islands that may reasonably be covered is also limited by the time-consuming nature of the existing approach: the shoreline or accepted shoreline proxy of the island(s) in question is digitized from the high resolution imagery by hand using ArcMap, a tricky process that requires careful attention.

Accordingly, I set out to develop an approach to monitoring atoll island land area which operated at the global scale. Key to this was using the freely available Google Earth Engine (GEE), a platform for geospatial analysis that allows users to harness cloud-based super-computing to dramatically increase the scale at which research may be undertaken. The GEE catalog contains a vast amount of data which constantly being expanded and refined. Critically, the majority of the current Landsat archive is available for use within GEE.
